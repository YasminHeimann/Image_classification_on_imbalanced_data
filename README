                FILES
======================================
The project contains the following files:
models.py - a class of a simple CNN
dataset.py - a class of a dataset used in pytorch
Model_Training.py - a module that trains the network in models.py
Model_Evaluation.py - a module that evaluates a neural network
Adversarial_Example.py - a module the generate adversarial examples from a given trained images
                         neural networks' classifier
README - this file.
311546915.ckpt - a checkpoint of the trained model with the defined parameters
				 in the training module.
Answers.pdf - a review of the model's learning process and final results

         PROJECT DESCRIPTION
======================================
The attached project traines, evaluates and generates a nueral network model
that classifies images of three classes: car, truck and cat, using PyTorch package.
The project also support generation of advarsarial examples from a given
trained neural network.

======================================
           TECHNICAL INFO
======================================
For running the project, you need to have a train and a test set, and adjust
all the paths defined in the macros at each module.
The supplied model is trained on an Imbalance subset of CIFAR10.
The modules assume using the path from where you run the project.
You can adjust the hyper-parameters of the network for training as you wish.

Enjoy!
